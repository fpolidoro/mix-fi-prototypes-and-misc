## Heatmap reconf _y_
This is a reconfiguration of [heatmap reconf _y_](https://github.com/fpolidoro/d3-steps/blob/question-star/questionnaire/heatmap_reconf_x) after a zoom out has been performed for both the _x_ and the _y_ axes. The _x_ axis displays the week of the month and the _y_ axis displays the month; each square shows the sum of the number of steps made on a specific week within a specific month (e.g. week 2 of April). 

### :joystick: Interaction
Hover and click on the squares displays the cumulative number of steps made on, for example, the week 2 of April.
