## Heatmap reconf _x_
This is a reconfiguration of [heatmap chart land](https://github.com/fpolidoro/d3-steps/blob/question-star/questionnaire/heatmap_land) after a zoom out has been performed on the _x_ axis. The _x_ axis displays the month and the _y_ axis displays the day of the week, each square shows the sum of the number of steps made on all specific week days of that month (e.g. Saturdays of May). 

### :joystick: Interaction
Hover and click on the squares displays the cumulative number of steps made on, for example, all the Saturdays of May.
