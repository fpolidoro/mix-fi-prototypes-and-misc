        <h3>What is this study about?</h3>

        <p>This study investigates the intuitiveness and level of comfort of touch screen gestures for mobile information visualisations.</p>

        <h3>Do I have to take part?</h3>
        <p>Participation to this study is totally voluntary and you can withdraw at any moment for any reason before submitting your answers by closing the browser.</p>

        <h3>What are the questions like?</h3>
        <p>If you agree to take part then you will be asked to perform some touch gestures on a visual file browser and rate the intuitiveness
            and level of comfort of these gestures. You will also be asked some background questions that will help us make sure that touch 
            interfaces are intuitive and natural for anyone, regardless of their gender, age, and cultural and educational background.</p>

        <h3>How will the data be used?</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this questionnaire is to evaluate the visualisations and the gestures and not your performance in accomplishing the tasks.
            The collected data will help us understand the users' preferences concerning touch interaction with smartphone information visualisations
            and contribute to make touch interaction more comfortable for everyone.</p>
        <p>This study is anonymous, however we might still be able to identify you indirectly from the data we collect, which could reveal your age,
            gender and nationality.</p>
        <p>In any case, we will take all reasonable measures to ensure that all the data remain confidential.</p>
