#     mix-fi-prototypes-and-misc
This repository contains all the files produced different stages of the study on mixed-fidelity prototypes carried out over the course of the PhD.

## Structure
- `d3-charts/` Contains the interactive visualizations created with the D3.js library and the data contained in `data`
- `data/` Contains CSV and JSON files used as input for generating charts and visualizations.
- `limesurvey/` Includes HTML and JavaScript files discussed in Chapter 7 of the [thesis](https://github.com/fpolidoro/thesis-uol), specifically for customizing LimeSurvey questions and enabling interaction tracking.
- `misc/` Contains additional scripts developed to support prototype behaviour and survey customization.
- `sprites/` Hosts manually-coded prototype examples used to test the feasibility of mix-fi prototypes based on sprite-sheets and to support the development of the [Sketch-A-Touch](https://github.com/fpolidoro/sketch-a-touch) tool. These files represent editable, optimized listings meant for further customization by practitioners and were also tested directly on mobile devices before Sketch-A-Touch was implemented.
