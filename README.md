#     mix-fi-prototypes-and-misc
This repository contains all the files produced different stages of the study on mixed-fidelity prototypes carried out over the course of the PhD.

## Structure
- `data/` Contains CSV and JSON files used as input for generating charts and visualizations.
- `limesurvey/file_browser/` Includes HTML and JavaScript files discussed in the study, specifically for customizing LimeSurvey questions and enabling interaction tracking.
- `questionnaire/` Hosts manually coded prototype examples used to test the feasibility of mix-fi interactions and to support the development of the [Sketch-A-Touch](https://github.com/fpolidoro/sketch-a-touch) tool. These files represent editable, optimized listings meant for further customization by practitioners and were also tested directly on mobile devices before Sketch-A-Touch was implemented.
- `utils/` Contains additional scripts developed to support prototype behaviour and survey customization.
