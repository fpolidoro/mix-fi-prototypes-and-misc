## Heatmap
This page displays a heatmap reprensenting the step count data. The view is not generated from the data but is instead a sprite sheet that shows one of the possible reconfigurations of the data.

The sprite sheet has been generated by manually tweening the static views of [heatmap_land](https://github.com/fpolidoro/d3-steps/tree/question-star/questionnaire/heatmap_land) and [heatmap_reconf_x](https://github.com/fpolidoro/d3-steps/tree/question-star/questionnaire/heatmap_reconf_x) with Illustrator so to create a low-fi animation.

### :joystick: Interaction

**Pinching** the chart triggers the animation of the sprite sheet to obtain a reconfiguration of the data.
