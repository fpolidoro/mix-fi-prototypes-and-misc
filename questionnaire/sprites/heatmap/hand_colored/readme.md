## Heatmap
This page displays a heatmap reprensenting the step count data. The view is not generated from the data but is instead a sprite sheet that shows one of the possible reconfigurations of the data.

The sprite sheet has been drawn by hand and colored so to obtain a paper prototype that mocks the charts generated by the D3 library.

### :joystick: Interaction

**Pinching** the chart triggers the animation of the sprite sheet to obtain a reconfiguration of the data.
