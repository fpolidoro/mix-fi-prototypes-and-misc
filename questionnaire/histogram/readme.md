## Histogram
This is the page that displays the step count data in form of an interactive histogram. 

### :joystick: Interaction

**Pinching** the _x_ axis triggers a zoom (in or out) and therefore a reconfiguration of the data. More in particular:

- **level 0** (zoom in), displays the number of steps made at a specific time of the day
- **level 1** [standard], displays the daily steps
- **level 2** (zoom out), displays the cumulative number of steps made on a specific week of the year
- **level 3** (zoom out), displays the cumulative number of steps made on a specific month  

**Pan** The _x_ axis can be scrolled horizontally to explore other sections of the dataset
